This is an example project for test automation. 
Selenide, TestNG are used as primary technologies.
`CLI commands.txt` includes commands to run test suites with different options (headless browser for example).
Keep it mind, above mentioned commands may not run from bash, or other *nix shell due to path name (`\` vs `/`) conflict.
Windows should run everything fine.
